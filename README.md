## 1. <a name="categories">Five Categories of Firewalls</a>

**Five categories of firewalls include:**

*Packet Filtering Firewalls:* These are firewalls that examine packets' IP headers and discard the packets that have been flagged.

*Circuit-Level Gateway Firewalls:* Instead of investigating packets individually, these firewalls use network protocol session initiation messages (such as TCP handshakes) to flag content if it is malicious.

*Stateful Inspection Firewalls:* These firewalls utilize both session monitoring and packet filtering.

*Proxy Firewalls:* Also known as Application-Level Gateway Firewalls, these firewalls rely on HTTP request strings and destination/target ports for their conditional logic.

*Next-Generation Firewalls:* Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) rely on context-awareness at the application-level with advanced intelligence, providing support against complex security threats.

## 4. <a name="comparison">Comparing Three Vendors: Palo Alto, Fortinet, Sophos</a>

When comparing *Palo Alto*, *Fortinet*, and *Sophos* firewalls, Palo Alto's may be seen as the luxury choice: their software is easy to find, industry renowned, and highly secure, but purchase and implementation can be costly. Comparatively, Fortinet may be seen as a 'bang for your buck' option, with beginner-friendly usability and high performance at its lighter price point, and Sophos may be a strong option for small-to-medium sized businesses with limited funding and less networking/security expertise. Thus, system complexity, budgeting, and integration/feature needs should be considered if selecting among these three vendors.
