## 1. <a name="categories">Five Categories of Firewalls</a>

Five categories of firewalls include:

**Packet Filtering:** These are firewalls that examine packets' IP headers and discard the packets that have been flagged.

**Circuit-Level Gateway:** Instead of investigating packets individually, these firewalls use network protocol session initiation messages (such as TCP handshakes) to flag content if it is malicious.

**Stateful Inspection:** These firewalls utilize both session monitoring and packet filtering.

**Proxy:** Also known as Application-Level Gateway Firewalls, these firewalls rely on HTTP request strings and destination/target ports for their conditional logic.

**Next-Generation:** Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) rely on context-awareness at the application-level with advanced intelligence, providing support against complex security threats.
